# MidJourney Case Study

*A simple case study of MidJourney*

## Overview and Origin

* **Company:** <span style="font-family:cursive">MidJourney</span>

* **Incorporated:** 2021 in San Francisco, CA.

* **Founder:**  <span style="color:orange">David Holz</span>

* **Inspiration**
> David's vision for MidJourney stemmed from a lifelong fascination with exploring the creative potential of computers. Holz continues to shape MidJourney following his ethics and creativity and watching it all grow with collaboration between humans and AI.

* **Funding:** Having experience from being a co-founder for Leap Motion, David self funded the project from its roots and now they are seeing around $200 million in annual revenue - all without investor funding. A good portion of its revenu is continually reinvested back into the company.

## Business Activities

* **MidJorurney's Goals** From listening in to David speak in their weekly office hours in discord, MidJourney seems to be a passion project to bring the ability to express creativity to anyone. You can see it in the way their model handles images and feelings, as the team has focused on more 'vibey' directions in training. Currently in their development process they are working on their web solution to access the ai outside of discord.

* **MidJourney's Client Base** This specific Ai focuses on text to image generation and is aimed for creativity and vibe. David wants the ability to express creativity in imagry to be more available to everyone and is against the idea of gate keeping being creative.

* **MidJourney's Advantage** MidJourney is very different from other text to image models out there like DALL E 3, Gemini and others as it has put a big focus on "vibe" - capturing feelings and sensations within their images. It can be hard to explain but easy to show when you use the same prompt on each model and get vastly different responses. You need less to get more with MidJourney

* **Which technologies are MidJourney currently using, and how are they implementing them?** One of the biggest technologies they have been using from the start is Discord for user interface and holding their community in a discord. It brings the user closer to the development process and team directly. This large community base helps them train their models with the communities support and host events like daily prompt challenges to help guide that community support.
