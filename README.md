# MidJourney Case Study

*A simple case study of MidJourney*

## Overview and Origin

* **Company:** <span style="font-family:cursive">[MidJourney](https://www.midjourney.com/home)</span>

* **Incorporated:** 2021 in San Francisco, CA.

* **Founder:**  <span style="color:orange">David Holz</span>

* **Inspiration**
> David's vision for MidJourney stemmed from a lifelong fascination with exploring the creative potential of computers. Holz continues to shape MidJourney following his ethics and creativity and watching it all grow with collaboration between humans and AI.

* **Funding:** Having experience from being a co-founder for Leap Motion as well as other prior entrepreneurial ventures, David self-funded the project from its roots and now they are seeing around $200 million in annual revenue - all without investor funding. A good portion of its revenue is continually reinvested back into the company.

## Business Activities

* **MidJorurney's Goals** From listening to David during the weekly office hours on [Discord](https://discord.gg/midjourney), it's clear that MidJourney is a passion project aimed at enabling everyone to express their creativity. As an independent research lab, MidJourney's commitment is evident in the way their model processes images and emotions, focusing on creating 'vibey' and evocative outputs. The team's dedication to this artistic vision is palpable. Currently, they are developing a web solution to make their AI accessible outside of Discord, further expanding its reach and impact.

* **MidJourney's Client Base** This specific Ai focuses on text to image generation and is aimed for creativity and vibe. David wants the ability to express creativity in imagry to be more available to everyone and is against the idea of gate keeping being creative.

* **MidJourney's Advantage** MidJourney is very different from other text to image models out there like DALL E 3, Gemini and others as it has put a big focus on "vibe" - capturing feelings and sensations within their images. It can be hard to explain but easy to show when you use the same prompt on each model and get vastly different responses. You need less to get more with MidJourney

* **Current Tech** 
    * One of the biggest technologies they have been using from the start is Discord for user interface and holding their community in a discord. It brings the user closer to the development process and team directly. This large community base helps them train their models with the communities support and host events like daily prompt challenges to help guide that community support.

## Landscape

* **MidJourney's Feild** MidJourney is in the generative AI space, focusing specifically on text to image art space.

* **Trends and Innovations** Generative AI is not a totally new idea or technology, and has been around as early as the 1960's via chatbots, the first being ELIZA. AI research and tech hit a slow down around the 70's for various reasons and didn't begin to recover until the 90's. Through to the 2000's we made strides in facial recognition and other AI tech but starting in

It isn't until the 2020's however that we begin to see the start of the AI Revolution we seem to be in currently. Most sources attribute this ingition of AI with the public on the release of ChatGPT with Dall-E, MidJourney and other generative AI

Since then, everyone has been improving and AI tech has been spreading futher across industries. 
    
* **Major Competitors** 
    - DALL-E 3
    - DaVinci AI
    - Stable Diffusion
    - Adobe Firefly

## Results

* **MidJourneys Impact** MidJourney has made significant strides in the generative AI space, particularly with its focus on text-to-image generation. By August 2022, the MidJourney community had roughly one million members, showing substantial user engagement and growth. The revenue of around $200 million annually without investor funding indicates a strong financial performance and a sustainable business model driven by organic growth and community support.

* **Here are some of the ways they have been successful and measure success since release in 2022:**
  - _User Engagement:_ Number of active users and community members participating in prompt challenges and events.
  - _Revenue Growth:_ Annual revenue generated, which is currently around $200 million.
  - _Quality of Generated Images:_ User feedback on the quality, creativity, and emotional impact of the images via rating systems.
  - _Community Growth:_ Expansion of the community on Discord, as well as into their web and mobile apps.

* **MidJourney vs Comptetitors**
MidJourney distinguishes itself from competitors like DALL-E 3, Stable Diffusion, and Adobe Firefly by focusing on the 'vibe' and emotional resonance of the images it generates. This unique focus on creating evocative and atmospheric visuals has helped MidJourney carve out a niche in the generative AI space. Its strong community presence and the innovative use of Discord for user engagement further enhance its competitive position.
